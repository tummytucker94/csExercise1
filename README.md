# csExercise1
The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize myself with using C# and Algorithm Design.

I used the following algorithm to design this simple program:

Goal: Write a program in C# that prints the message 'Hello' and your name.

Start
1) Set the value of "message" to the string "Hello". //process
2) Get a value for "myName". // input
3) Set the value of "result" to "message + ': ' + myName".//process
4) Print the value of "result". //output
Stop
